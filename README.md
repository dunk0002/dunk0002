## Hello, I'm Davis Dunkleberger!

I am a programmer, data analyst, sports nut, and general nerd. My main capabilites are in R, but I have experience with Python and SQL as well. I am a recent graduate (May 2024) from the University of Oklahoma with a Masters of Science in Sports Data Analytics and a graduate certifacte in Applied Statistics. I obtained two undergraduate degrees in Sports Business and Management Information Systems from the University of Oklahoma as well.

I am looking for opportunities in data analytics inside of and outside of sports. My coursework at OU prepared me to tackle the world of data analytics and real life applications. I look forward to finding where I can utilize my talents as I begin my professional career. I am a goal oriented, team player with a passion for problem solving.

Previous working experience: lawn care, mortgage document review, custodial services, graduate teaching assistance, and more


### Projects and Previous Work
- [Thesis: Does Pulling the Goalie Lead to a Playoff Appearance?](https://github.com/dunk0002/Pulling-The-Goalie-Thesis): my thesis project for my Masters of Science. This project focused on evaluating if pulling the goalie helps teams make the playoffs. 
- [Data Science for Economists class](https://github.com/dunk0002/DScourseS23): a graduate level course that focused on different modeling methods, data imputation, and coding practices. [ProblemSets](https://github.com/dunk0002/DScourseS23/tree/master/ProblemSets) demonstrate my abilities with course material
- [Machine Learning in Hockey](https://github.com/dunk0002/Machine-Learning-Predicting-Goals): a final project for Data Science for Economists. Utilized four of the five tribes of Machine Learning to predict how many goals a player was expected to score.
- [Genome Searching Project](https://github.com/dunk0002/Genome-Searching): a final project for my Python course in graduate school. This project created an automated way to search through a database for genome matches that did not exist previously.
